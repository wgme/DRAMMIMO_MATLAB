% Desciption:
% 1. Based on the code from Dr. Marko Laine 
%    (http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/mcmc/).
% 2. Also based on the math from Dr. Ralph C. Smith 
%    (Uncertainty Quantification: Theory, Implementation, and Applications).
% V01: N/A.
% V02a: N/A.
% V02b: The code was used for dissertation, named propErrDRAMMIMO(). 
%       The code was a modified version of the mcmcpred() function in 
%       Dr. Marko Laine's MCMC toolbox for MATLAB.
% V03: The name was changed from propErrDRAMMIMO() to getDRAMMIMOIntervals().
% V04a: The code for saving results was added.
% V04b: N/A.
