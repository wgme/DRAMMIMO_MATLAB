# DRAMMIMO_MATLAB
Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis Multi Input Multi Output for MATLAB.

This package utilizes a modified version of the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) algorithm to realize the Maximum Entropy (ME) method numerically. 

The original DRAM algorithm is based on the MATLAB toolbox from Dr. Marko J. Laine (https://mjlaine.github.io/mcmcstat/) and the book [1] from Dr. Ralph C. Smith. It uses the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.

The Maximum Entropy method can be used for fusing data from hetergeneous sources and quantifying uncertainty of model parameters that are shared among models [2]. When only one set of data is available, the Maximum Entropy method automatically becomes the Bayesian method, and the algorithm is equivalent to the original DRAM algorithm.

The package provides code for MATLAB environment. An equivalent version for Python environment can be found at https://github.com/wgme/DRAMMIMO_Python. Currently, there is only one simple linear model to demonstrate how to use the package; see main.m for details. More complicated examples will be added in the future.
